  National Language Support

 _ ____________________________________


5.1 Introduction

National language support for this version of MS-DOS 3.3 includes these
major features:

 o Country-dependent information

 o Support for national keyboard layouts

 o Programming interfaces for national language support

 o Utility commands

Country-dependent information is available on a per-country basis and
includes the following:

 o Time, date, and currency

 o Lowercase-to-uppercase character-conversion tables

 o Collating sequence for character sorting

 o Valid single-byte characters used in filenames

Selectable keyboard support for different keyboard layouts is provided.

The MS-DOS 3.3 programming interfaces for national language support
allow applications to use the country-dependent information just
described. To access this information, applications do not need to change
the current country code of the system.

Utility commands allow the user to select the keyboard layout and system
country code.

This version of MS-DOS does not support right-to-left national languages.

5.2 National Language Support Calls

The following function calls allow an application to tailor its operation to
the current country code and to accept or change the current code page.
A country code defines the country in which you live or work. MS-DOS
uses this code to prepare and assign default code pages for your system. A
code page is a table that defines the character set you are using. A
character set is a country-specific or language-specific group of characters
that are translated from the code page table and displayed on your screen
or printer. Each code page character set contains 256 characters.

The following function calls are also used by MS-DOS 3.3 to support the
National Language requirements:

 o Function 44H, Code 0CH (Generic IOCtl) \(em supports code page
 switching on a per-device basis.

 o Function 65H (Get Extended Country Information) \(em returns
 standard country information, and points to related case-map or
 collating tables.

 o Function 66H (Get/Set Global Code Page) \(em gets or sets the code
 page used by the kernel and by all devices.

These functions support access to country-dependent information, all of
which resides in one file named country.sys.

5.3 Font Files

Font files, also called code page information files, contain the images of
code page character sets for use by console-screen or printer devices.
These font files are identified by a filename extension of .cpi. Four font
files are included with MS-DOS 3.3:

Font file
 Supported device
_ ________________________________________________________________

ega.cpi Color console used with an EGA card

lcd.cpi Liquid crystal display

4201.cpi IBM Proprinter

5202.cpi Quietwriter III printer


5.3.1 Font File Structure

The contents of printer or console-screen font files are structured as fol-
lows:

 +--------------------------------------+
 | 22-BYTE File Header |
 +--------------------------------------+
 | WORD Information Header |
 +--------------------------------------+
 | 13-BYTE Code Page Entry Header |
 +--------------------------------------+
 | 6-BYTE Font Data Header |
 +--------------------------------------+
 | Variable size Font Header(s) |
 +--------------------------------------+

 Figure 5.1 Font File Structure

The font file fields are described in the following sections.

5.3.1.1 File Header

Each file must begin with a file header that includes the following:

Length
 Parameter
_ ________________________________________________________________

8 BYTES File tag

8 BYTES Reserved

WORD Number of pointers

2 WORDS Offset

where:

File tag begins with the byte 0FFH and is followed by a string "font "
(seven characters).

Reserved is eight bytes of zeros.

Number of pointers is the number of pointers in the header. For MS-DOS
3.3, the value of this word should be 1.

Offset is the two-word offset from the beginning of the file.

5.3.1.2 Information Header

Following the file header is a one-word information header:

Length
 Parameter
_ ________________________________________________________________

WORD Number of code pages

where:

Number of code pages is the number of code page entries in the file.

5.3.1.3 Code Page Entry Header

For each code page entry, a header in the following format is included in
the font file:

Length
 Parameter
_ ________________________________________________________________

WORD Length

WORD Pointer

WORD Device type

8 BYTES Device subtype

WORD Code page ID

WORD Reserved

2 WORDS Offset

where:

Length is the size of the code page entry header.

Pointer points to the next code page entry header (last header=0, 0).

Device type is 1 if the device is a console screen, or 2 if the device is a
printer.

Device subtype names the type of console screen or printer. This field also
determines the name of the font file. For example, if the subtype is
"CGA," the font file name is cga.cpi

Code page ID defines a valid three-digit code page identification number.
Valid code page numbers are 437, 850, 860, 863, and 865.

Reserved is eight bytes of zeros.

Offset is a pointer to the Font Data Header.

5.3.1.4 Font Data Header

The Font Data Header includes the following fields:

Length
 Parameter
_ ________________________________________________________________

WORD Reserved

WORD Number of fonts

 _ ____________________________________

WORD Length of font data

where:

Reserved must be 1.

Number of fonts is equal to the number of fonts defined in the font file.

Length of font data is equal to the size of the font-data portion of the font
file.

5.3.1.5 Font Header

The font-data portion of a font file will vary for each device. The struc-
ture of the font-data portion consists of a set of data for each font type.
The following illustrates the data portion of a font file for a console-screen
device:

font_header: 
 db 16, 8 ; character pixels 
 ; (rows, columns)
 db 0, 0 ; aspect ratio (unused)
 dw 256 ; number of characters in set


len_data equ ($ - font_header)
