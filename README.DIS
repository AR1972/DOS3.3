The CLONE VERSION DISTRIBUTION DISKETTES contain the files that were produced
from MS-DOS SOURCE CODE assembled with the IBMVER switch on but the
IBMCOPYRIGHT switch off.  They contain full SOURCE CODE to IO.SYS, MSBOOT,
FORMAT.EXE, PRINT.EXE, SORT.EXE and partial source code to MSDOS.SYS to allow
for the customization of DOSMES.INC. MSDOS32101 is a bootable disk.

The MS VERSION SUPPLEMENTAL DISKETTE contains files that were produced from
MS-DOS SOURCE CODE assembled with the MS-VER switch on and the IBMVER and
IBMCOPYRIGHT switch off.  They contain the executables for the four files DEBUG,
MORE, RECOVER and SHARE as well as partial source for MSDOS.SYS to allow for
its customization.  These are all the files with version switches in them except
for the files with complete source on the CLONE VERSION.

The MS-DOS 3.30 PACKAGED PRODUCT contains file that were produced from MS-DOS
SOURCE CODE assembled with the IBMVER switch on but the IBMCOPYRIGHT
switch off.  These two disks that are identical to the disks in the manufactured
packaged product.  There is a boot disk and supplemental disk.

The CLONE VERSION MESSAGE MODULES contain all the source code that must be
modified for translation to a language other than English.
These message source modules can be modified, then assembled and linked with the
object modules that are provided to make the executables.  The object modules
in this release were made from MS-DOS SOURCE CODE assembled with IBMVER switch
on and the MSVER and IBMCOPYRIGHT switches off. Code is provided to make all
the executables on the CLONE VERSION DISTRIBUTION DISKETTES except for
the files that have complete source provided on the CLONE VERSION DISTRIBUTION
DISKETTES: IO.SYS, MSBOOT.BIN, FORMAT.EXE, PRINT.EXE, SORT.EXE, SYS.COM, and
MSDOS.SYS (partial source).

Microsoft now offers complete translations including documentation for the
following languages: French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and Dutch.
OEMs who would like one or more of these translations added to their OEM
contract should contact their Microsoft OEM Account Manager.

MS VERSION SUPPLEMENTAL MESSAGE MODULES contain all the source code that
must be modified for translation to a language other than English for the
six files: COMMMAND.COM, DEBUG.EXE, MORE.COM, RECOVER.EXE, SHARE.EXE and
MSDOS.SYS.  They are used the same way as the CLONE VERSION MESSAGE MODULES,
except the the files they are linked to have been assembled with the
MSVER switch on.

The MS-DOS CLONE VERSION DISTRIBUTION DISKETTES, and the PACKAGE PRODUCT
DISKETTES are provided as a part the MS-DOS 3.30 Standard OEM ADAPATION KIT.

The CLONE VERSION MESSAGE MODULES, the MS VERSION SUPPLEMENTAL MESSAGE MODULES
and the MSVER SUPPLEMENTAL DISTRIBUTION DISKETTE, MODULES may be available to
an OEM under special conditions by request through their Microsoft OEM Account
Manager.

The SOURCE CODE release is not generally available to OEMS, however, it is
archived for support purposes by OEM Customer Support.

The BUGFIX DISKETTE contains code that fixes certain known problems in the
MS-DOS 3.30 Release.  These fixes have been applied to the MS-DOS 3.30
PACKAGED PRODUCT, but were not applied to the the MS-DOS 3.30 OEM Release
to maintain IBM COMPATIBILITY.	An OEM can use this code to apply these
bugfixes to their product.  The specific bugs are described in the release
notes and in the the README.BF file on the BUGFIX DISKETTE.

tools		    <dir>

The files in this directory are used to make the parts of the MSDOS product.
None of these files(except exe2bin.exe), however are part of the MS-DOS product
and they should not be supplied to an OEM's customers.

convert.exe	special file to change certain .EXE files to .COM files
dbof.exe	used to insure that boot record is located proper on disk
exe2bin.exe	same as exe2bin.exe in product - it is included here as
		as a convenience
exefix.exe	used by some makefiles to convert .EXE files to .COM files
gwbasic.exe	same gwbasics as in packaged procduct.	It is used by the
		makefile in format - it is included here as a convenience
link.exe	linker used to build msdos
masm.exe	masm.exe from  Retail Macro Assember 4.00 Product
masm401.exe	special masm used to build IO.SYS
msmake.exe	make utility - renamed msmake to distinquish it from XENIX make

3. Instruction for use.

The MS-DOS release installation procedure is described in Chapter 3 of
the MS-DOS 2.XX/3.XX adaptation guide.

It is recommended that the DISTRIBUTION DISKETTES be copied over
to a hard disk with the XCOPY.EXE command.  This will set up
a directory tree that the makefiles can use properly.  All the
buildables on the DISTRIBUTION DISKETTES can be built by setting
the PATH to SRC\TOOLS and running the MAKEFILE in the SRC directory.
It is important that the file be built in the order that they are
by this makefile as there are some dependencies on former builds
having occurred.

It is also recommended that MS-DOS 3.30 is installed on the build
machine and that the build occurs under MS-DOS 3.30.  This will
insure that any version dependent tools will perform properly.	MS-DOS
3.30 can be installed on the build machine by booting from the floppy
with the boot disk from either the DISTRIBUTION DISKETTES or the PACKAGED
PRODUCT and then using the SYS command or FORMAT /S to get the system to the
hard disk.

System Filenames are MSDOS.SYS and IO.SYS in FORMAT and SYS.

FORMAT.EXE and SYS.COM have the boot sector installed with INSBIN.EXE.

The OEM NUMBER is FF.

Build Scripts require that the files EXE2BIN.EXE and DEBUG.EXE be in the PATH.

The 8-bit OEM Serial number may be installed with DEBUG by patching MSDOS.SYS
at location 355H (455 under DEBUG).

The 24-bit OEM User number may be installed with DEBUG by patching MSDOS.SYS
at location 352H (452 under DEBUG).

SYSINIT  LINK REQUIREMENTS.

    SYSINIT1.obj now requires an external FAR routine called StackInit
    to be linked.  This routine has available to it the parameters

	    STACK_ADDR:  DWORD
	    STACK_SIZE:  WORD
	    STACK_COUNT: WORD


    StackInit initializes the Stack Heap and corresponding interrupt
    vectors used to handle potential hardware driven stack overflows.
    After completing its task, StackInit issues a RETF to return to
    SYSINIT1.
	       To use the IBM compatible SYSINIT1, the OEM must
    provide the FAR ROUTINE StackInit, whose only task is to issue a
    RETF.


The CONVERT utility is provided in the TOOLS directory to
rename certain .EXE utilties as .COM files if desired.	The CONVERT utility
is not part of the MS-DOS product and should be used only as
described as follows:


Documentation for CONVERT.EXE

CONVERT is used by entering CONVERT and an .EXE file name (with the .EXE
extension).

CONVERT FOO.EXE

	will build a FOO.COM file


CONVERT adds an .EXE loader onto the .EXE file image

It should not be confused with EXE2BIN.EXE

These are the differences:

EXE2BIN

   - EXE2BIN is a utility for converting .EXE files to binary (.COM).

   - EXE2BIN produces a .COM file which is smaller than the .EXE file.

   - EXE2BIN may only convert files conforming to a certain documented set of
     requirements.

   - EXE2BIN can only be used on a file written as .COM file (ORG 100h, not
     stack segment).


CONVERT

   - CONVERT transforms an .EXE file into a .COM file by appending the
     MS-DOS loader to the end of the file.

   - A CONVERTed file will be larger than an equivalent .EXE file.

   - CONVERT will convert ANY .EXE program.

   - CONVERT should only be used in UNUSUAL circumstances, such as when
     an application program demands that a file have a .COM extension.



4. Differences in the files in the MS VERSION and CLONE VERSION of MS-DOS

This is a complete list of the differences between the MS VERSION and the
CLONE VERSION of MS-DOS at the 3.XX level.  It is intended to illustrate how
few the differences actually are.  These differences occur as a result of
conditional assemblies based on whether MSVER or IBMVER is TRUE at the time
of assembly.

		CLONE VERSION			      MS VERSION

==================================================================

OEM_HANDLER	OEM_HANDLER code	       OEM_HANDLER code

		CLONE VERSION			      MS VERSION
SHARE
==================================================================

     NOTE: The MS VERSION and CLONE VERSION  do have minor
	   differences and will not file compare.  The differences
	   have to do with the DOS data modules linked in with SHARE.
	   The CLONE VERSION SHARE, MSDOS and REDIR should be used only with
	   each other and the MS VERSION SHARE, MSDOS and REDIR should be
	   used only with each other.

	NOTE: SETTING THE IBM SWITCHES TO TRUE IN PRINT
		WILL NOT YIELD A BINARY THAT IS THE SAME AS THE IBM
		3.2 .

		In PRINT's case this is due to some slight code
		re-organization that was needed to get a valid
		PRINT with the IBM switches set to FALSE.
